### 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

  - Classes & Objects: Core entities (Flight, User, Booking)
  - Encapsulation: Private members with public methods
  - Inheritance: Admin and User from a common base class (optional)
  - Polymorphism: Function overloading and virtual functions (if used)
  - Abstraction: Separation of logic into classes
  - File Handling: Data storage and retrieval
